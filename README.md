# Supersingular Isogeny Graph Database
Database of Supersingular $l$-isogeny graphs. Continuation of [Gerard Finol's and Enric Florit's database](https://isogenies.enricflorit.com/).




## Data

At each prime $p$ and each prime $\ell = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17$ we record the following data of $G_p(\ell)$:
- $\lambda_2(G)$
- $\lambda_{\text{Max}}(G)$
- Spectral Gap
- Spectral Radius
- Cheeger Constant
- Girth
- Diameter
- Number of Loops and Multiedges
- Is Simple?
